A large fountain~
A simple, but impressively large fountain marks the center of Midgard. Made
of stone, the fountain is as old as the town itself, and serves as a gathering
place for the people of Midgard, as well as travellers passing through.

A row of flowers wrap around the stone structure and line the roads going in
all directions.~
